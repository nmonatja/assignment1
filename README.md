This code includes three systems: A, B and C. All data files are read from the DataSets folder and all output files are written out to the DataSets folder.

Each system will have compiled java code that you can run if you first go into the System folder and then run:
java Plumber

If you would like to re-compile the code first, you can go into the System folder of your choice and then run:
javac *.java
java Plumber
